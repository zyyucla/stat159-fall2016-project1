###Discussion
   
Writing an essay that covers several software tools is certainly not an easy task. This section will briefly discuss the resources that I used to get the job done and thoughts on writing the essay.

One of the most helpful sources is also the most convenient one--github repository for lab work. Tutorials of Shell, Git and Makefile provide me basic information of how to navigate each tool. Another good help comes from the supplementary links from each lecture page on course website, such as "User guide for pandoc" and "Git Reference" which give me a deeper understanding of each tool. Lastly, there's always the powerful internet (specifically Wikipedia) whenever I'm confused when accomplishing the task.

The easy parts are creating local repository, downloading images and writing abstract and conclusion sections. The challenging parts are writing Makefile and the introduction sections. Most time consuming was definitely brainstorming and writing down the introduction sections. I was mostly stuck with writing Makefile and pandoc as I'm not very familiar with both of the tools. 

I got help from TA by going to her office hour and sending emails. Also surprisingly I received help regarding software use from statistical lab assistant by simply emailing and face-to-face interaction. The whole project from start to finish took me about 15 hours.
