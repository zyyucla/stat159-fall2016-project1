<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Statistical data analysis is essential in conducting any scientific research. This essay will give a brief overview of key computational tools in writing this essay and the role that each tool play in this process. Specifically, Markdown is the &quot;pencil&quot; for writing plain text of this essay; Pandoc converts the text from Markdown to HTML; Makefile gives automation instructions on how to convert the essay into HTML file and Git/GitHub are in charge of distributed version control by creating repositories to keep track of all the changes we make to the files.</p>
<p>Commentary about writing the essay and thoughts on collaboration will also be discussed. It's expected that, after reading, the targeted audience is able to reproduce the essay using the tools discussed in the content.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Working on any project requires following a certain workflow to achieve goals. The process of writing this essay is very similar to finishing a project: through planning schemes and software, this essay aims to introduce some computational tools used in writing the essay and how each tool contribute to its overall workflow.</p>
<h4 id="markdown"><strong>Markdown</strong></h4>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" />
</div>
<p>Every big project starts with the smallest component, so let's first talk about the &quot;pencil&quot; used in writing the essay--Markdown.</p>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax so that it can be converted into HTML or any other formats. Readability is in its core philosophy as the language intends to be easy-to-read and easy-to-write.</p>
<p>Let's take the essay for example. The title &quot;introduction&quot; and current section &quot;Markdown&quot; is written in different header size, which is indicated by the number of &quot;#&quot; in front of it. In markdown editor, we write it as: <code>###Introduction  ####Markdown</code> which gives us a h3 header size for introduction and h4 header size for Markdown title. Notice that Markdown title is also in bold. To do that, we simply write <code>###**Markdown**</code> where asterisk is used to indicate emphasis.</p>
<p>Next we want to incorporate the Markdown-logo image into the text. The syntax is <code>![alt text](url)</code>. <code>[alt text]</code> is displayed when the image url is not valid. To have the same effect as what you are seeing in the essay, try to type</p>
<pre><code>![markdown-logo] url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucb-stat159/stat159-fall-2016/master/projects/proj01/images/markdown-logo.png)</code></pre>
<p>in the text editor and see for yourself.</p>
<p>Lastly, to demonstrate code/syntax highlighting, inline code has backticks around it and for blocks of code, use three backticks. This section only covers a very small amount of markdown syntax. For a complete reference, follow the link <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links">Markdown Cheatsheet</a> and try it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="pandoc"><strong>Pandoc</strong></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" />
</div>
<p>As the logo suggests, Pandoc is a software tool to convert documents between formats, usually from a markup one to another. I would like to think of Pandoc as &quot;dictionary&quot; in writing the essay in that they both translate from one language to another.</p>
<p>Pandoc is free and open-source, but the biggest advantage/usefulness is that it allows you to move easily between files. For example, suppose you write a paper in LaTex but submission requires .docx. Pandoc understands an extension of Markdown structured text format, so it will correctly interpret your source and cope with mathematical formalism, bibliography and footnotes, which makes the conversion incredibly painless.</p>
<p>To convert the essay (written in markdown) into HTML file, we can simply type <code>pandoc -s introduction.md -o introduction.html</code> Here <code>-s</code> option says to create a &quot;standalone&quot; file and <code>-o introduction.html</code> says to put the output in file <code>introduction.html</code>. We will see more of pandoc in <strong>Makefile</strong> section. Check out <a href="http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html">Pandoc</a> to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="makefile"><strong>Makefile</strong></h3>
<p>Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable program from source code by reading files call <em>Makefile</em> that specifies how to derive the target program. To put it simply, Makefile is analogous to a translator when you want to translate your essay from English to Spanish.</p>
<p>Converting the essay from markdown to html requires two steps. First step is to concatenate all separate .md files into one single file. We first use the name <strong>all</strong> to indicate multiple target files <code>all: paper.md paper.html</code>. Then type <code>paper.md:paper/sections/*.md     pandoc paper/sections/*.md -s -o paper/paper.md</code> to concatenate all md files. Here *.md is a wildcard indicating all files with md extension in the sections directory.</p>
<p>Next step is to convert paper.md into paper.html. As mentioned in the <strong>Pandoc</strong> section, command <code>pandoc paper/paper.md -s -o paper/paper.html</code> would suffice. The <code>.PHONY</code> command is simply a convenient label to indicate a series of target files. Meanwhile, the <code>clean</code> target is commonly used to remove output files typically generated after some compilation process. Include <code>phony</code> and <code>clean</code> targets as follows: <code>.PHONY: all clean     clean:       rm -f paper/paper.md paper/paper.html</code></p>
<h3 id="git"><strong>Git</strong></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/git-logo.png" />
</div>
<p>Most of the times when you write an essay you can't finish it in one sitting or need to revise many times, so you save unfinished documents as drafts into a folder. This is similar to git’s functionality. Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to keep a record of file changes over time, so specific versions can be recalled later. Let’s see how git contributes in producing the final version of essay that you are reading.</p>
<p>When using git for the first time, we need to configure a few things. In the command line, type <code>git config --global user.name &quot;your name&quot;  user.email &quot;your email address&quot;</code>. The username and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity. Next we need to set up the directory and repository for the essay.</p>
<p>Use <code>mkdir</code> and <code>cd</code> commands to make and change into that directory, respectively. We want to have a paper and images directories inside the big project directory called &quot;project1&quot;. To do that, type <code>mkdir project1</code>. Next to create paper and image directories, type <code>cd project1</code>-&gt;<code>mkdir paper</code>-&gt;<code>mkdir images</code> in your command line. This is where git comes into play, type <code>git init</code> to initialize an empty git repository. This tells git to keep track of subsequent changes that we make to the project1 directories.</p>
<p>Next we want to use git to record changes made in the files. For convenience, only introduction part of the essay is discussed. In the paper directory, make a directory <code>mkdir sections</code> then <code>cd</code> into it. To open and edit a file, you could choose your preferred editor such as emacs or vi (I used nano in this case). So <code>nano introduction.md</code> will create a markdown file called introduction. After done editing the file, you should tell git to keep track of your files. Simply type <code>git add introduction.md</code>. This is similar to saying that you now have introduction.md version 1. You also want to record what the changes are, which are called <em>commit</em>. Use <code>git commit -m your message</code> to summarize the changes you make to the file. Finally, to have a general view of the project status, type <code>git status</code> to see if you have any untracked files or changes that you haven't commited yet.</p>
<p>Notice that each time we make revisions to the introduction.md file, we need to repeat the command <code>git add introduction.md</code> and <code>git commit -m message</code> to record the changes. Finally, use <code>git log</code> to see a history of commit logs. Combined with <code>add</code> <code>commit</code> and <code>log</code> command, I can easily retrieve older version of my introduction draft and it's easier for other people to follow my workflow and possibly reproduce my work.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, sometimes you don't want certain files to be tracked by git, then simply create a file called <strong>.gitignore</strong> and include the extension names that you don't want to track (i.e <em>docx</em>, <em>md</em>).</p>
<h3 id="github"><strong>GitHub</strong></h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/github-logo.png" />
</div>
<p>Suppose you finish writing the essay and want to publish it online for a wider audience or simply want to collaborate with others, then having an online central remote hub connected to your local repository is a good idea . GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service and it's the general way of sharing your changes with others on the web.</p>
<p>To start with GitHub, go to the <a href="https://github.com/">website</a> and create an account and a repository. To connect local repository (the one we created in <strong>Git</strong> section called <em>project1</em>) with GitHub, we run this command: <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/zyyucla/project1.git</code> where <em>zyyucla</em> is my GitHub username and <em>project1</em> is the repository name I created on GitHub. The name <em>origin</em> is a local nickname for the remote repository.</p>
<p>Once the two repositories are connected and synchronized, type <code>git push origin master</code>, which will push the changes from local repository to the one on GitHub. Reversely, command <code>git pull origin master</code> will pull changes from remote repository to local one. When writing this essay, I made commits and push the changes to GitHub regularly, which is essential in working on this project as it allows for better source code management and public peer review(though it's an individual project, it never hurts to get feedback from other people!).</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Writing an essay that covers several software tools is certainly not an easy task. This section will briefly discuss the resources that I used to get the job done and thoughts on writing the essay.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful sources is also the most convenient one--github repository for lab work. Tutorials of Shell, Git and Makefile provide me basic information of how to navigate each tool. Another good help comes from the supplementary links from each lecture page on course website, such as &quot;User guide for pandoc&quot; and &quot;Git Reference&quot; which give me a deeper understanding of each tool. Lastly, there's always the powerful internet (specifically Wikipedia) whenever I'm confused when accomplishing the task.</p>
<p>The easy parts are creating local repository, downloading images and writing abstract and conclusion sections. The challenging parts are writing Makefile and the introduction sections. Most time consuming was definitely brainstorming and writing down the introduction sections. I was mostly stuck with writing Makefile and pandoc as I'm not very familiar with both of the tools.</p>
<p>I got help from TA by going to her office hour and sending emails. Also surprisingly I received help regarding software use from statistical lab assistant by simply emailing and face-to-face interaction. The whole project from start to finish took me about 15 hours.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, by utilizing several common software tools one is able to produce an essay that describes the workflow of the essay. Markdown is used to write the plain text and pandoc is used as a document format converter. Makefile directs <em>make</em>, the automation tool on how to do the format conversion. Git/Github as version control system provide repository to keep track of the changes we make to the essay/project. A sufficient familiarity of tools described above is essential in working individual/collaborative project and conducting reproducible research in the future.</p>
